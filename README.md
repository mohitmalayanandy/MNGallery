## ABOUT THE PHOTOGRAPHER :-

                       I am an Odia Photographer, @[mohitmalayanandy](https://instagram.com/mohitmalayanandy)  based in Balasore, Orissa, India. I started photography in 2012, When my Father Purchased a Nikon Coolpix Camera. That time I was in 7th standard & we lived at Malkangiri, Odisha. So I usually loved to take the pictures of nature, birds, mountains, waterfalls, temples etc. Then I took lots of pictures of the life of peoples at village. Later I had chance to come to Balasore for study. Only In 2020 I started to take some professional pictures & developed my own style of Photography. My own feelings and creativity helped me develop my talent as a Photographer. I always focusing on finding my own creativity, different from other Photographer.

## WHAT IS MY PROSPECTIVE OF PHOTOGRAPHY :-

                       From my Outlook photography is not just an art, It is an feelings of the photographer. I can‚Äôt really explain how to accomplish it but I have realized that when I get the image that I feel is just right that . I believe Photography is not only about the camera, rather it is about the photographer. I am a green panther, like to wonder around the sphere and capture even small things are interesting to me. I like to pick the real beauty of Nature through my photography. I‚Äôm passionate about photography, about my thoughts, and about my personal ideas, and I‚Äôm just trying to express what I think. I‚Äôm not just showing my passion for a sport or a fashion, but it‚Äôs about what I feel, and it‚Äôs about what I‚Äôm looking for. That‚Äôs what it makes me a great photographer.

## ABOUT MY PHOTOGRAPHY PROCESS :-

                     As I mentioned before, I usually have my camera or mostly mobile in Nature photography and Bird portraits. Since most of my photography has to be done in Evening time or early morning and I can‚Äôt go out of my house, so I rely on my phone. As for Samsung, its faster and more and most recently. I am learning how to use my Camera & Capturing Nature at it‚Äôs best.

## MY PHOTOGRAPHY EXPERIENCE :-

                In photography, I always try to take pictures that are a reflection of my personal view. I never try to have a ‚Äòview‚Äô that I want others to see, I just try to describe my own personal experience. And that‚Äôs why photography is not a representation, but it‚Äôs a personal approach. And for me, as a photographer, the important thing is to express what you see, what you feel. How you experience something in a personal and expressive way. Again, it‚Äôs not about ‚Äòthe shape‚Äô, or ‚Äòwhat it looks like‚Äô, or even ‚Äòwhat other people think‚Äô, it‚Äôs about what the photographer perceives in his own personal way. And when I take pictures of others, I‚Äôm not trying to show something that‚Äôs not mine to express. It‚Äôs about capturing what you‚Äôre feeling. And that‚Äôs it. I make what others see and let them interpret it in their own way. And that‚Äôs why Photography can be a universal language. And I don‚Äôt want to criticize people that are just taking pictures for a commercial purpose, or taking pictures to show something that‚Äôs not there. I‚Äôm just showing my personal view.
